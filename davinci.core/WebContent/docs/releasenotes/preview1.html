<h1>Maqetta Preview 1</h1>

<h2>Goals with the Preview 1 release</h2>

<p>The Preview 1 release includes many features, including 
	a visual page editor (including simultaneous visual and source editing), 
	a theme editor and web-based review and commenting.</p>
<p>The following items list those features in Maqetta Preview 1 
	that are <em>recent additions</em> to the code base:</p>

<ul style="margin-top: 0pt;" type="disc">
	<li><strong>Web-based review and commenting</strong>. 
		Maqetta now includes a "New Review" command on the "New" menu
		that allows an author to launch a team review of a UI mockup.
		The New Review command presents a short wizard that allows the author
		to pick the files that need to be reviewed and pick the list of reviewers
		(via email addresses). Upon clicking "Publish", the reviewers
		receive an email invitation that contains a URL. Upon clicking on the
		URL, the reviewers will be taken to a web page where they can view the mockup
		and provide feedback using forum-style text comments or on-screen annotations
		(rectangles, ovals, arrows and text).
	</li>
	<li><strong>Initial mobile authoring features</strong>. 
		There have been recent code additions to allow for authoring mobile user interfaces.
		The features in the Preview 1 release represent an initial and only partial delivery of mobile authoring features.
		Lots of enhancements in this area are planned for the future.
		With the Preview 1 release,
		users can construct mobile user interfaces within the context of a life-size device silhouette.
		Silhouettes are available for a handful of devices. 
		A small collection of dojox.mobile widgets from Dojo 1.5 are available on the widget palette.
		In a subsequent release, Maqetta will upgrade to Dojo 1.6 and support the rich mobile widget library
		that is under development at Dojo.
		</em>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Custom themes by cloning one of the existing themes</strong>.
		With Preview 1, there is a New Theme... command that allows you to clone one of
		the themes that ships standard with the product, such as "claro" and "sketch".
		You can then use the theme editor to do style modifications on your newly created theme.
		The "Open Claro Theme Editor" command has been changed to "Open Theme Editor",
		and it now prompts you to choose a theme to open in the theme editor. 
		The "claro" and "sketch" themes are now designed to be read-only themes.
		<em>These theme management features are recent additions and we recognize
		that this feature area is not yet complete.</em>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Initial support for DataGrid</strong>. 
		Maqetta Preview 1 includes limited support for the Dojo DataGrid widget.
		With this release, support is limited to text data entered manually
		(via multiple lines of comma-separated data for the cells in a particlar row)
		or linked to a simple JSON file containing simple row/column textual data.
		<em>Note: Future releases will enhance DataGrid support in major ways.</em>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Download/deploy workspace (or selected files) to developer tools</strong>. 
		With Preview 1, there are two new download icons on the Files palette
		that allow the author to create a ZIP file out of his entire workspace
		or from selected files.  One goal with this feature is
		to enable a smooth workflow between Maqetta in the cloud and 
		Eclipse-based developer tools. The feature includes options to move
		the location of JavaScript libraries (e.g., dojo) to alternate locations
		in case the authors directory structure is different than the development
		team's directory structure.The feature also allows the author
		to choose whether or not to include JavaScript libraries in the ZIP.
		(Including the libraries is needed to create a self-sufficient runnable
		application image, but if deploying to development tools, the 
		JavaScript libraries might already be in the developer tool workspace.)
	</li>
<!-- 
	<li><strong>Save as widget, export widget and import widget</strong>.
		With Preview 1, a user interface defined within a single HTML file
		can be saved as an OpenAjax Widget (the widget format used by Maqetta)
		by clicking on the "Save As Widget" icon found on the editor toolbar.
		The widget can then be exported into a ZIP package to enable sharing
		with other users, who can import the ZIP package into their
		Maqetta workspace.
	</li>
-->
	<li><strong>Support for IFRAME and IMG elements</strong>. 
		Maqetta Preview 1 now includes
		support for the HTML &lt;iframe&gt; and &lt;img&gt; elements.
		The &lt;iframe&gt; widget can be used to modularize
		development of a UI mockup such that sections of the mockup
		can be stored in external files.</em>
	</li>
<!-- 
	<li><strong>Support for Dialog and Tooltip widgets</strong>.
		With Preview 1, we made significant progress on supporting "modal overlay widgets" -
		widgets (such as Dialog, Tooltip, Menu, and TooltipDialog) 
		that appear as temporary overlays on top of the (more permanent) page content.
		In the Preview 1 release, we are providing initial support for Dialog and Tooltip.
		When activating a Dialog for editing, the Dialog becomes a mini page
		container into which the user can drag/drop widgets that become
		the content of the Dialog.
		(In the next release, we will add Menu and TooltipDialog.)
	</li>
-->
	<li><strong>Manage locations of (and relocate) JavaScript libraries</strong>.
		With Preview 1, there is a new manage libraries icon on the Files palette
		that allows users to control where JavaScript libraries such as Dojo
		should be located, either at a particular location within their cloud
		workspace, or located externally (e.g., on a CDN).
	</li>
	<li><strong>UI changes to Properties palette, including easier management of CSS classes</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>The Properties palette has been rewritten to use a new slide-in/slide-out
				approach (with slide-in animations on Chrome, Safari and Firefox4).
				There are now 3 levels. The top-most (initial) level shows buttons that
				list the sub-sections (e.g., Common, Events, Layout, etc.).
				After clicking on a button, the 2nd level sub-section (e.g., Layout properties)
				slides in. For CSS properties, there is a 3rd level that shows
				CSS details for a single property (e.g., 'width' or 'height').</li>
			<li>For easier management of CSS classes (and promoting best practices in using CSS), 
				various aspects of the Properties palette have changed.
				Maqetta has moved the 'class'
				attribute to the top of the Properties palette's where it is always
				visible (and therefore always editable). Also,
				the CSS details view shows not only all of the CSS style
				rules that apply to the given property on the current widget,
				the CSS detail view also shows "proposed new style rules".
				By selecting the radio button for one of these "proposed new style rules"
				and then changing the property value, Maqetta will automatically
				create a new style rule in the app.css file that contains the new
				property value.</li>
			<li><em>The Maqetta team believes they are converging on nice approaches
				for visual styling of widgets and HTML elements, but we expect some
				additional minor improvements in the near future.</em></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>On-screen widget data entry improvements</strong> 
		With Preview 1, we cleaned up the UI for widget data entry, where for most widgets
		we use a TooltipDialog widget (a "pointy popup") that is located just under
		the top-left of the widget. The data entry popup now includes OK and Cancel
		buttons, thereby allowing a user to cancel changes (which wasn't possible in 0.7).
		The data entry popup include a "?" icon which brings up some short help text
		that explains the formatting rules for that particular widget.
		In 0.7, there was a hard-to-understand "HTML markup or plain text" popup
		that was incomprehensible to many users. With Preview 1, we hide that choice
		from users except when it is absolutely necessary, and when it does appear,
		it is less incomprehensible and has defaults that usually do the right thing.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Major performance fixes to source editor</strong>. 
		Most of these performance issues with the source editor in prior releases have been addressed in Preview 1.
	</li>
</ul>
