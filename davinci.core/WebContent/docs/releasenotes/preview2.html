<h1>Maqetta Preview 2</h1>

<h2>Goals with the Preview 2 release</h2>

<p>The Preview 2 release includes the following updates:</p>

<ul style="margin-top: 0pt;" type="disc">
	<li><strong>Mobile authoring updates</strong>. 
		The most significant new capabilities with the Preview 2 release are in the area of
		mobile user interface authoring. In the previous release (Preview 1), the mobile authoring
		features were barely there and mostly showed a vision for future mobile authoring features.
		With the Preview 2 release, significant mobile authoring capability is now available.
		In particular:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Nearly complete support for the new Dojo 1.7 mobile widget library</strong>
				With Dojo 1.7, there is now a complete collection of mobile widgets that provide
				native look&amp;feel - mobile web widgets that look and act like native device
				controls. Maqetta Preview 2 supports nearly all of the Dojo 1.7 mobile widgets
				so that designers can drag/drop assemble a mobile user interface.</li>
			<li><strong>Device silhouettes are now pixel-perfect</strong>
				There have been numerous fixes and improvements to the Maqetta feature that allows
				authoring inside of an actual-size image of a mobile device (a "device silhouette"). 
				With the preview release (Preview 1), the screen areas for the silhouettes were incorrectly sized.
				With Preview 2, the screen areas now have exactly correct sizes (e.g., iPhone interior is exactly
				480x360 pixels).</li>
			<li><strong>Preview-in-browser now uses device silhouettes, with zoom control</strong>
				With the preview release, device silhouettes appeared in the page editor but
				did not appear if you clicked on the preview-in-browser icon. 
				With Preview 2, preview-in-browser will render inside of the current device silhouette
				used by the Maqetta page editor. The previewer user interface provides a zoom control
				(using CSS3 transforms) so that grow or shrink the preview in order to: (a) zoom in/out so that
				the preview will be the same size as the target device, (b) zoom in to look more closely
				at certain UI components, (c) zoom out in case the whole user interface is too large for your display .</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>User workspaces now use Dojo 1.7</strong>. 
		Maqetta Preview 2 has updated all user workspaces that use Dojo to use Dojo 1.7. (Preview 1 used Dojo 1.5.)
		This update to Dojo 1.7 was mostly necessary to support the updated dojox.mobile widget set that 
		is included in Dojo 1.7, but it also keeps Maqetta up to date with latest features in Dojo.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Usability improvements to Web-based review and commenting</strong>. 
		We had a major usability issue with review and commenting with the Preview 1 release
		that we have addressed with the Preview 2 release. On Maqetta.org, when reviewers
		received an email invitation to participate in a review session, they would 
		almost always have to login to Maqetta.org and often have to register as a new user.
		These login and register processes confused the application, which ultimately
		would take a reviewer into the page editor user interface instead of the review user interface.
		With Preview 2, reviewers will be taken to the review user interface even if they
		have to login and/or register.<br />
		There are other various minor UI improvements around review and commenting, including
		an improved email invitation.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Built-in themes (claro and sketch) are now read-only</strong>.
		With Preview 2, the two built-in themes (claro and sketch) are now
		read-only. If a user wants to make theme changes, they have to first
		clone one of the built-in themes into a custom theme.
		This enhancement prevents a user from damaging these built-in themes
		using the page editor or theme editor, and therefore a user can always
		recover back to the built-in themes. 
	</li>
	<li><strong>DataGrid can now read in data from a file (URL) in user workspace</strong>. 
		With Preview 1, DataGrid accepted user-entered dummy data in the form
		of multiple rows of comma-separated information. With Preview 2,
		DataGrid can now pull its data from a JSON file from the user's workspace.
		(In a future release, we will add support for reading JSON from an arbitrary
		URL, but this requires cross-domain data access, which didn't make it into Preview 2.)</em>
	</li>
	<li><strong>No longer need to clear cache with new releases</strong>. 
		Preview 2 includes "cache busting" logic that ensure that new releases of Maqetta
		will pull new versions of Maqetta JavaScript files automatically instead of possibly using
		the JavaScript files from earlier releases.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Many bug fixes</strong>. 
		Preview 2 includes many miscellaneous bug fixes. Some of those fixes
		can be seen by going to <a href="https://github.com/maqetta/maqetta/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1&milestone=13">this URL which lists bugs closed against the Preview 2 release</a>.
