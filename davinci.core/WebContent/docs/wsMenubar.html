<h3><b>New</b></h3>
<h3 style="margin-top:1em;">HTML File...</h3>

<p>This creates a new User HTML file, which is what you use to create your page designs. The file is created with the tags needed to use the Maqetta widgets and the Maqetta theme files. See <a href="peUserHTML.html">About the User HTML File</a> for more information on source that is auto-generated for HTML files.</p> 

<p>A dialog window opens where you can enter a filename and specify the folder in which to place the new file.  A default filename is provided for convenience, which you can change if desired. To select a sub-folder, scroll through the list to find the desired sub-folder, then select it by clicking on it. The sub-folder will appear in the text box under <b>Parent Folder:</b>. If you want to place your new file in a folder that doesn't yet exist, first select <b>New Folder...</b> to create the folder.

<h3>CSS File...</h3>

<p>This creates a new CSS file which can be used in addition to or instead of <a href="peAppCss.html">app.css</a>, which is provided by Maqetta as the default application CSS file. If you create your own CSS file, you will need to update the &lt;style&gt; tag in your HTML file (see <a href="peSourceEditing.htm">Source Editing</a>) to link to your CSS file. (app.css is already linked in for you.)</p>

<h3>File...</h3>

<p>This creates a new blank file.</p>

<h3>Theme...</h3>

<p>This creates a new CSS theme by cloning an existing CSS theme.</p>

<h3>Folder</h3>

To select a sub-folder, scroll through the list to find the desired sub-folder, then select it by clicking on it. The sub-folder will appear in the text box under <b>Parent Folder:</b>.</p>

<h3>Review</h3>

<p>This command initiates a web-based review and commenting session with team members.
<em>(Note: this feature only works in practice when running Maqetta off of a web server.
When installing locally, in most scenarios, you can only successfully invite yourself.)</em></p>

<p>A dialog wizard comes up that allows you to choose which files (i.e., UI mockups) should be reviewed and 
the list of other people (via email addresses) who need to be invited to the review activity.
Upon filling out the fields in the wizard and clicking "Publish", the invitees will
receive email invitations. The emails will include the URL which will launch Maqetta in review mode,
where reviewers can look at the mockups and provide feedback via forum-style plain text comments
or on-screen annotations.</p>

<h3><b>Open</b></h3>
<h3 style="margin-top:1em;">File...</h3>

<p>Opens an existing file under the Maqetta root folder or one of its sub-folders. Scroll through the list to find the desired file, select the file by clicking on it, then click <b>Open</b> to open the file.</p>


<h3>Theme Editor</h3>

<p>Opens the Theme Editor, where you can view or modify the style properties on one of the CSS themes known to the application.</p>

<h3><b>Settings</b></h3>
<h3 style="margin-top:1em;">Preferences...</h3>

<p>The <b>JavaScript/Formatting</b> preferences allow you to specify formatting options that you prefer for the JavaScript that is generated by Maqetta in the <a href="peUserHTML.html">User HTML files</a>.

<p>The <b>HTML/Visual Editor</b> preferences allow you to specify the following options:</p>

<table class="palette">
<thead><tr><th colspan="2">Visual Editor Preferences</th></tr></thead>
<tr><th width="20%">Flow Layout</th><td>(Default is checked) Checked turns on flow layout as the default system-wide positioning for all widgets. Unchecked uses absolute positioning as the default system-wide positioning for all widgets.  The system-wide positioning can be overridden on any particular widget by setting the <b>Position</b> property, in the <b>Layout</b> section of the <a href="pePropertiesPalette.html">Properties palette</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Snap To Grid</th><td>(Default is unchecked) Not implemented yet.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Show Grid</th><td>(Default is unchecked) Not implemented yet.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Warn on CSS Override</th><td>(Default is checked) Provides a warning message if you attempt to update a style rule from one of the /theme files while making style changes using the <a href="pePropertiesPalette.html">Properties palette</a>.</td></tr>
