	<h2 class="test_section">Backgrounds, borders, margins, padding properties using shortcuts</h2>
	<h3 class="steps_subsection">Steps</h3>
	<ol class="steps">
		<li>Create a virgin user environment navigating away from daVinci, clearing browser cache,
			killing the server, removing users/ folder, restarting the server, and navigating browser
			back to daVinci. (For server-hosted, create a new user)</li>
		<li>Issue a "New HTML File" command.</li>
		<li>Drag a ContentPane onto the canvas, and then put a LABEL, TextBox and Button inside the ContentPane.</li>
		<li>Go to Properties palette and for all widgets,
				change all of the background properties, the border shortcut property,
				the border-radius shortcut property,
				the margin shortcut property and paddding shortcut property to new values,
				making sure to test each property at least once for at least one widget.
				<blockquote>Note that you will get a prompt in some cases warning you that you
				might be changing a global CSS style sheet. Say OK to these warnings,
				but note that this will changes your theme CSS files. After running this
				test, you'll want to make sure you recreate your user so that the
				theme CSS files are restored to their original state.</blockquote>
				<blockquote>Note that background-color and background-image can collide. An opaque background-image
				will mask the background color.</blockquote> 
				<blockquote>The background image dialog shows a gradient option.
				No need to verify that feature for the basic test plan, especially since
				most browsers don't support that particular CSS3 feature yet.</blockquote></li>
		<li>Click on the "Save" icon on the main toolbar to save the new file. <span style="color:red">The asterisks that indicates that the file is "dirty" should go away.</span></li>
		<li>Click on the "X" close button for the editor tab for this file</li>
		<li>In the Files palette, double-click on the file you just created to re-open the file.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3 class="expectedResults_subsection">Expected results</h3>
	<ol class="expectedResults">
		<li>As you change the properties, the canvas should update so that the widgets reflect the styling changes you made.</li>
		<li>As you change the properties, the Properties palette's text entry and 
				preview areas should update to reflect the changes you made.</li>
		<li>After save and reopen, the saved file should open and its contents should be the same as how it was when you clicked on the Save button.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2 class="test_section">Border, margin, padding detail properties</h2>
	<h3 class="steps_subsection">Steps</h3>
	<ol class="steps">
		<li>Create a virgin user environment navigating away from daVinci, clearing browser cache,
			killing the server, removing users/ folder, restarting the server, and navigating browser
			back to daVinci. (For server-hosted, create a new user)</li>
		<li>Issue a "New HTML File" command.</li>
		<li>Drag two DIV elements onto the canvas.</li>
		<li>Select the second DIV. Double-click and set text to "abc".</li>
		<li>Go to Properties palette and set the border shortcut to "1px solid black", 
			border-radius shortcut to "4px", 'margin' shortcut to "10px" and 'padding' shortcut to "5px".</li>
		<li>Under 'border' property on Properties palette, choose the option to
			show "props". Set border-width to 3px, border=style to dotted, border-color to red.
				<blockquote>You should see these changes on the design canvas.</blockquote>
		</li>
		<li>For each of the above properties, issue "remove value".
				<blockquote>DIV should be restored to its default settings.</blockquote>
		</li>
		<li>Using Undo, restore original properties: border shortcut to 1px solid black,
			border-radius shortcut to 4px, margin shortcut to 10px, padding shortcut to 5px.</li>
		<li>Choose the option to show border sides. Set left border to "3px dotted green".
				<blockquote>You should see these changes on the design canvas.</blockquote>
		</li>
		<li>Choose the option for borders to show all. Set border-top-width to "7px" and border-right-color to blue.
				<blockquote>You should see these changes on the design canvas.</blockquote>
		</li>
		<li>Under 'border-radius' property on Properties palette, choose the option to
			show details. Set border-top-right-radius to 20px.
				<blockquote>You should see these changes on the design canvas.</blockquote>
		</li>
		<li>Under margins and padding, turn on "show t/r/b/l". Set margin-left to 20px and padding-top to 10px.
				<blockquote>You should see these changes on the design canvas.</blockquote>
		</li>
		<li>Click on the "Save" icon on the main toolbar to save the new file. <span style="color:red">The asterisks that indicates that the file is "dirty" should go away.</span></li>
		<li>Click on the "X" close button for the editor tab for this file</li>

	<h3 class="expectedResults_subsection">Expected results</h3>
	<ol class="expectedResults">

		<li>As you change the properties, the Properties palette's text entry and

	</ol>

	<h2 class="test_section">Fonts and Text properties</h2>
	<h3 class="steps_subsection">Steps</h3>
	<ol class="steps">
		<li>Standard setup things: Clear the browser cache. Launch the daVinci server. 
				Login if necessary. 
				In some cases, you'll want to setup a virgin user environment by creating a whole new user login.</li>
		<li>Issue a "New HTML File" command.</li>

		<li>Drag a DIV onto the canvas.</li>
		<li>Drag a Label inside the DIV and enter "Label 1" as the label text.</li>
		<li>Drag another Label inside the DIV and enter "Label 2" as the label text.</li>
		<li>Click in the white space inside the DIV (outside of the labels) so the DIV is selected.</li>
		<li>Go to Properties palette and change various text-related values in the Text twisty: 
				font-family, font-size, font-color, bold, italic, text-decoration, text-align. 
				<br />"Label 1" and "Label 2" should inherit the values set on the DIV.
				<br />The labels should move to left, center and right as you click on the DIV's text-align buttons.</li>
		<li>Click inside "Label 2" to select it.</li>
		<li>Go to Properties palette and change <em>some</em> of the text-related values in the Text twisty.
			Note how the values set on "Label 2" override the inherited values from the DIV.</li>

		<li>Drag a TextBox and a DIV onto the canvas.</li>
		<li>Select the TextBox. Double-click to bring up text input
			editing control and set the value to "abc"</li>
		<li>Select the DIV. In the Properties palette, set 'width' to '200px', 
			double-click on DIV, and set the value to "abc def abc def abc def abc def abc def".
			</li>
		<li>Go to Properties palette and for both the TextBox and DIV,
			change various text-related values in the Text twisty.
			For the DIV, change all of the values, particularly
			white-space:nowrap and white-space:pre (in both cases,
			the text should extend past the end of the DIV).
			For TextBox,
			you might find that some of the values have no effect (e.g., line-height and text-indent).
			<blockquote>Click OK when prompt asks OK to change global style sheet.
			Note that you should recreate a new user after running this test
			so that in the future you will be using original CSS theme files.</blockquote>
		</li>
		<li>Click on the "Save" icon on the main toolbar to save the new file. <span style="color:red">The asterisks that indicates that the file is "dirty" should go away.</span></li>
		<li>Click on the "X" close button for the editor tab for this file</li>
		<li>In the Files palette, double-click on the file you just created to re-open the file.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3 class="expectedResults_subsection">Expected results</h3>
	<ol class="expectedResults">
		<li>As you change the properties, the canvas should update so that the widgets reflect the styling changes you made.</li>
		<li>As you change the properties, the Properties palette's text entry and preview areas should update to reflect the changes you made. 
				<br />The font-family and font-size areas should show the new values as text. 
				<br />The 'color' widgets should be solid filled with the chosen text color.
				<br />The bold, italic, underline and justification icons should be highlighted to match the toggling state for those properties.</li>
		<li>The text for the labels inside the DIV should show the values you set for the DIV. 
		    <br />The text for "Label 2" should show a mixture of the inherited DIV values and the values set on the label.
		    <br />Any values set on the label element should override the values set on the DIV element.</li>
		<li>As you click the text-align buttons on the DIV, you should see the labels move within the DIV (left-justify, center, right-justify).</li>
		<li>After save and reopen, the saved file should open and its contents should be the same as how it was when you clicked on the Save button.</li>
