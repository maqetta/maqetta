/*
 * This file is provided for application-specific style rules.
 *
 * By default, Maqetta includes this CSS file within HTML pages
 * authored in Maqetta.
 *
 * This file is typically used to override style rules found in
 * theme CSS files. For example, suppose the theme CSS file has:
 *
 * .claro .dijitButton .dijitButtonNode {
 *		padding:2px 4px 4px 4px;
 * }
 *
 * But for your application suppose you want to tighten the padding
 * for buttons. Then, you might include the following style rule
 * in this file (assuming that you accept Maqetta's default where
 * id "myapp" is present on the BODY element, and assuming
 * that you are using the "claro" theme):
 *
 * #myapp.claro .dijitButton .dijitButtonNode {
 *		padding:1px 3px 3px 3px;
 * }
 *
 * Because of CSS precedence rules (see [1]), the above style rule
 * (which begins with #myapp.claro) will "win the cascade" versus 
 * the style rule from the theme CSS file due to the use of the
 * ID select (#myapp), which has higher specificity than the class
 * selectors used throughout the Claro theme.
