    c) depending on what directory you unzipped to and the exact filenames, you will add something like

--------
To install/run less version 2 on mac:

1. Install Node.js
	Download a built copy from https://github.com/ajaxorg/node-builds.
	Alternately, o to http://nodejs.org/#download   (./configure, make, make install).
	
2. Download less from https://github.com/cloudhead/less.js/archives/master

3. Edit .bash_profile etc. to add node to your path, and lessc to NODE_PATH:

	export PATH=$PATH:/opt/less/bin
	export NODE_PATH=$NODE_PATH:/opt/less/lib

To compile all the files:

  $ cd dijit/themes/claro
  $ node compile.js


-------
Alternately, you can install less version 1, but I'd rather not use it for checked in files
since it breaks a part a lot of rules into multiple rules, causing spurious diffs.

To install on a mac:
  $ sudo gem install less
  
On Windows or Linux, make sure you have ruby and ruby-gems installed first.
If you need help installing ruby please check out ruby-lang.org for more details.
