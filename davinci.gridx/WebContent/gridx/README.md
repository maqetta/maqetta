## GridX Overview

#### **A fast rendering, well modularized and plugin architecture based Grid.**

Besides supporting a rich set of popular features, GridX is optimized and extremely capable of supporting huge dataset(e.g.[larger than millions of rows](http://evanhw.github.com/gridx/gridx/tests/test_grid_huge_data.html)).

GridX is consisted of:

* A compact and lightweight core
* A flexible plugin machinery with comprehensive module life-cycle and conflict management
* A rich and extend-able set of modules which can be loaded on demand.

GridX is available under [Dojo Toolkit](http://dojotoolkit.org/) with the same [BSD/AFLv2 license] (http://dojotoolkit.org/license)

## Installation

1.  [CPM installation](https://github.com/kriszyp/cpm) with the following command:

    ``cpm install gridx``

2.  Manual installation by putting GridX at the same level as Dojo, e.g:
 * dojo 
 * dijit
 * dojox
 * gridx

GridX works best with [Dojo 1.7.2](http://download.dojotoolkit.org/release-1.7.2/) or higher.
