<p>Files that you create in Maqetta are saved in your <a href="install.html">user workspace folder</a>. (If you are accessing Maqetta from the server then this is a folder associated with your username on the Maqetta server.
If you are running Maqetta locally then this is the local Maqetta workspace folder specified in the Maqetta startup file.
See <a href="install.html">Accessing / Installing Maqetta</a> for details.)</p>
<p>Files in the <a href="install.html">user workspace folder</a> are displayed in the <b>Files palette</b>.

<h3>Files Palette Toolbar</h3>

<p>The Files palette toolbar contains three icons:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Download entire workspace</b> - Creates a ZIP file containing all files in your workspace. A dialog appears that 
allows you to decide whether to include JavaScript libraries (e.g., Dojo) within the ZIP in order to make
a fully self-sufficient runnable workspace image, but note that the ZIP may be quite large due to the size of the libraries.
The dialog also allows adjusting the location of the JavaScript libraries in case you are targeting unpacking
the ZIP into a developer tool which assumes JavaScript libraries are at a different location (absolute or relative URL).</li>
<li><b>Download selected files</b> - Similar to the above command, except only files that are selected will be downloaded.
You have the same choices about whether to include JavaScript files and whether to relocate the libraries.</li>
<li><b>Manage libraries</b> - This brings up a dialog that allows you to manage the JavaScript libraries
that are used in your workspace, including whether to embed the libraries into your workspace or reference them
from an external URL (e.g., the Google Ajax CDN at <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/">http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Files Palette Context Menu</h3>

<p>The <b>Files palette</b> has a <b>context menu</b> with 4 commands:</p>

<ul>
<!-- FIXME: Maybe restore this if we get Save/SaveAs buttons in toolbar for generic New File source editing
 <li><b>New file...</b> - creates a new file for editing</li>
-->
 <li><b>New folder...</b> - creates a new folder in your Maqetta workspace</li>
 <li><b>Upload file</b> - uploads files from your local file system to your Maqetta workspace</li>
 <li><b>Rename</b> -  allows you to rename the currently selected file</li>
 <li><b>Delete</b> -  deletes the currently selected file from your Maqetta workspace</li>
  <li><b>Download</b> - zips and downloads the currently selected file(s) to your local system.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also access your Maqetta files from the <a href="wsMenubar.html">Maqetta Menu Bar</a>.</p>

<h3>Create New Files and New Folders</h3>
<p>New files and new folders can be created from either the <a href="wsMenubar.html">Maqetta Menu Bar</a> or the Files palette's context menu. Files can be saved into the user workspace root folder (indicated by a ".") or into a sub-folder (you create sub-folders using the <b>New folder...</b> command). See the <b>New</b> section under the <a href="wsMenubar.html">Maqetta Menu Bar</a> for details.</p>
-->
<h3>Create New Folders</h3>
<p>New folders can be created from either the <a href="wsMenubar.html">Maqetta Menu Bar</a> or the Files palette's context menu. Files can be saved into the user workspace root folder (indicated by a ".") or into a sub-folder (you create sub-folders using the <b>New folder...</b> command). See the <b>New</b> section under the <a href="wsMenubar.html">Maqetta Menu Bar</a> for details.</p>
<p>Note: You should not put your files in the Maqetta <b>themes</b> folder since this contains CSS files maintained by Maqetta.</p>

<h3>Upload Files</h3>
<p>You can also import files from your local file system into Maqetta using the <b>Upload file</b> option from the Files palette context menu. Upload will <b>copy</b> the file to the user workspace, into the folder specified under <b>Parent Folder:</b> in the dialog window. (To specify a sub-folder, first select the sub-folder in the Files palette, then bring up the context menu.) Once uploaded, the files will be displayed in the Files palette.</p>

<h3>Open Existing Files</h3>
<p>To open an existing file, either select <b>Open > Open File...</b> from the <a href="wsMenubar.html">Maqetta Menu Bar</a>, or double-click on the file in the <a href="wsPalettes.html">Files palette</a>. HTML files and image files are opened in the page editor canvas in <b>Design view</b>.  CSS and JavaScript files are opened in <b>Source view</b>.</p>

<h3>Delete Files</h3>
<p>To delete a file, first select it in the <a href="wsPalettes.html">Files palette</a>, then open the Files palette context menu and select <b>Delete resource</b>. Select OK at the "Are you sure" prompt to delete the file.</p>

<h3>Download</h3>
<p>You can export files from your Maqetta user workspace to your local file system using the <b>Download</b> option from the Files palette context menu. This will create a zip file containing the selected files.</p>
