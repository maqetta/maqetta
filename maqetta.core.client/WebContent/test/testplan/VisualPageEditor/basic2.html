	<h2 class="test_section">Widgets, images, open/save (relative layout)</h2>
	<h3 class="steps_subsection">Steps</h3>
	<ol class="steps">
		<li>Standard setup things: Clear the browser cache. Launch the Maqetta server. 
				Login if necessary. 
				In some cases, you'll want to setup a virgin user environment by creating a whole new user login.</li>
		<li>Click on the "New file" icon on the main toolbar. Choose any filename.</li>
		<li>Drag a few primitive widgets onto the canvas (e.g., Button, TextBox, Calendar).</li>
		<li>Drag an image onto the canvas (e.g., SampleBanner.jpg).</li>
		<li>Click on the "Save" icon on the main toolbar to save the new file. <span style="color:red">The asterisks that indicates that the file is "dirty" should go away.</span></li>
		<li>Click on the "X" close button for the editor tab for this file</li>
		<li>In the Files palette, double-click on the file you just created to re-open the file.</li>

	<ol class="expectedResults">
		<li>The saved file should open and its contents should be the same as how it was when you clicked on the Save button.</li>
		<li>The canvas should show the widgets and image(s) that you dragged onto the canvas.</li>

		<li>Re-open the file created in the previous steps.</li>
		<li>Drag a few container widgets onto the canvas (e.g., ContentPane, Accordion, TabContainer).</li>
		<li>Drag an HTML DIV widget onto the canvas.</li>
		<li>Drag a couple of primitive widgets into each container (e.g., Button, TextBox, HTML LABEL, HTML SPAN).</li>
		<li>Drag a couple of container widgets inside other containers to create nested containers (e.g., Accordion inside of a TabContainer). 
				Drag primitive widgets into the nested container widget.</li>
		<li>Click on the "Save" icon on the main toolbar to save the new file. <span style="color:red">The asterisks that indicates that the file is "dirty" should go away.</span></li>
		<li>Click on the "X" close button for the editor tab for this file</li>

				With relative layout, you should be able to re-order widgets within the flow via drag/drop. 
				With absolute layout, you should be able to change widget position.</li>
		<li>Some widgets are resizable and show resize knobs when selected. For example, ContentPane and Calendar. Drag the knobs to resize some widgets.</li>
		<li>Delete a widget by selecting it and then invoking the "Delete" command from the context menu.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3 class="expectedResults_subsection">Expected results</h3>
	<ol class="expectedResults">
